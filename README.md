Visual File Information
=======================

Visual File Information retrieves and generates file information. You can use this information for testing purposes to detect what files have changed in different versions of applications, or what the differences are between two seemingly identical machines. This information is also valuable to track different versions of resources that normally don't store version information. You can copy this information to the clipboard, or save it out to a tab-delimited text file.

** What is a CRC:
A CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checking) Key is a Checksum based on published standards (RFC and ISO). Basically, for a stream of bytes, the CRC algorithm computes a distinct 32-bit key. If the bytes in the stream change, the key changes. This makes it very easy to detect changes in files. You generate the CRCs and compare them, if they have changed the file has changed.
